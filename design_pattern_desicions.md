I made several design choices when creating this smart contract. 

1. I had originally designed the smart contract to host several unique FOMO3D games. People were able to propose their own FOMO3D game, which they could do through the smart contract and allow other users to submit transactions to increase the time left on the clock. After considering the security implications of this design, I decided it was not a safe idea. If we examine the FOMO3D smart contract, there is currently over $5,000,000 worth of Ether held by the smart contract. This large pool of money creates a strong incentive for bad actors to attempt to expoit any errors in this smart contract. By forcing each smart contract to be responsible for one game, I am decreasing the pool of money in each smart contract and dispering the attack serface. Even if every smart contract hosting this type of game was identical, an exploit in the code could only be taken advantage of one smart contract at a time.
